## Send To Kindle

A script allowing you to email multiple documents to your kindle from the
commandline.

Bugs:
- need a better way of supplying the password for the sender's email account
        right now it just does it with getpass which is __ok__

- Sometimes the attachments won't be recognized as a "kindle-compatible document"
and thus you'll receive an email about how you didn't attach anything.
